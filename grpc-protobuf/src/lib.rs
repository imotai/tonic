//! Protobuf integration for the [`grpc`] crate.
//!
//! These types are generally created by the generated code produced by
//! [`protoc-gen-rust-grpc`](https://docs.rs/protoc-gen-rust-grpc).  See our
//! [Quick Start Guide](docs/languages/rust/quickstart/) for more information.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! * [`client`] - Client-side types and call builders for RPCs.
//! * [`server`] - Server-side types, handler traits, and adapters for RPCs.

/// A helper trait to enforce and explicitly bound a [`Future`] as [`Send`].
///
/// This trait provides a mechanism to work around specific Rust compiler
/// limitations and bugs where the compiler's borrow checker or drop analysis
/// conservatively concludes that an `async` block is `!Send` (not safe to send
/// across threads),
/// even when it logically should be.
///
/// # Problem Context
///
/// As detailed in issues [#64552], [#102211], and [#96865], there are scenarios
/// where:
/// * An `async` function captures a reference to a type that is `!Sync`.
/// * A variable is dropped before an `.await` point, but the compiler's liveness
///   analysis incorrectly believes it is held across the await.
/// * Complex control flow confuses the auto-trait deduction for `Send`.
///
/// These scenarios often result in obscure error messages when trying to spawn
/// the future on an executor (like `tokio::spawn`), claiming the future is not
/// `Send`.
///
/// # The Solution
///
/// The `make_send()` method acts as an identity function (a no-op at runtime) but
/// performs two critical compile-time tasks:
///
/// 1.  **Explicit Assertion:** It requires `Self` to implement `Send` at the
///     call site. This moves the error message from the deep internals of an
///     executor's spawn function to the specific line where the future is created,
///     making debugging significantly easier.
/// 2.  **Type Erasure / Coercion:** By returning `impl Future<...> + Send`, it
///     creates an opaque type boundary. This can sometimes help the compiler's
///     trait solver "lock in" the `Send` guarantee and disregard phantom lifetime
///     issues that might otherwise propagate.
///
