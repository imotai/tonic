//! A HelloWorld example that uses JSON instead of protobuf as the message serialization format.
//!
//! Generated code is the output of codegen as defined in the `build_json_codec_service` function
//! in the `examples/build.rs` file. As defined there, the generated code assumes that a module
//! `crate::common` exists which defines `HelloRequest`, `HelloResponse`, and `JsonCodec`.

pub mod hello_world {
    include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/json.helloworld.Greeter.rs"));
