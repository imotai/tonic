//! xDS resource type implementations.

//! Each module implements [`xds_client::Resource`] for one of the four resource types:
//! - [`ListenerResource`] (LDS)
//! - [`RouteConfigResource`] (RDS)
//! - [`ClusterResource`] (CDS)
//! - [`EndpointsResource`] (EDS)
//!
//! These are *validated* types containing only the fields relevant to gRPC
